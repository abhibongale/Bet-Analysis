#### Index allows Fantasy Premier League managers way of assessing players’ performance this season

The ICT Index is a feature in [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/), offering insight to help guide your strategies and selections.

A football statistical index, it has been developed specifically to give a verdict on a player as an FPL asset.  

It uses match event data to generate a single score for three key areas – Influence, Creativity and Threat.

These figures then combine to create an individual’s ICT Index score.

While there is a wealth of data available to help assess player performance, including the statistics now presented on within [the Stats section on this site](http://www.premierleague.com/stats), the ICT Index finds the most important numbers and makes them easy to digest.

It condenses more than 40 match event statistics into four distinct scores. These offer a view on player performance for factors that are known to produce FPL points.

###### 1. Influence

Influence is the first measurement. This evaluates the degree to which that player has made an impact on a single match or throughout the season.

It takes into account events and actions that could directly or indirectly effect the outcome of the fixture.

At the top level these are decisive actions like goals and assists. But the Influence score also processes significant defensive actions to analyse the effectiveness of defenders and goalkeepers.

###### 2. Creativity

Creativity assesses player performance in terms of producing goalscoring opportunities for others. It can be used as a guide to identify the players most likely to supply assists.

While this analyses frequency of passing and crossing, it also considers pitch location and quality of the final ball.

###### 3. Threat

This is the third measure, producing a value that examines a player's threat on goal. It gauges individuals most likely to score goals.

While attempts are the key action, the Index looks at pitch location, giving greater weight to actions that are regarded as the best chances to score.

All three of these scores are combined to create an overall ICT Index score. That then offers a single figure that presents a view on that player as an FPL asset.

You can view the ICT Index scores for 2020/21 on any player information screen accessed via the 'I' icons next to each player.

The Index is also available within the dropdown as a filter on the Transfers page and in the tables under the Statistics tab.
